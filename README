Tool for graphing arbitrary data received from serial port.

Start it like this:
python SerialGraph.py

For command line argument information:
python SerialGraph.py -h

Originally designed as a replacement for the Windows-only program
that came with my laser power meter.

Requires Python 2.6 and the following modules:
serial
wx
matplotlib
numpy
pylab

Code heavily borrowed from Blended Technologies:
